  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>What started as weekend baking for my family has become so much more than I ever imagined.
Hi! I'm Lisah, and like many African families, mine gathered around food. I began baking simple cakes and cookies for my parents and siblings, learning through trial and error in our small kitchen. My friends started requesting my treats for study sessions, and before I knew it, I was the go-to person for homemade desserts in our circle.
Word spread quickly in our tight-knit community. Neighbors began asking if I could make cakes for their children's birthdays. Our church started requesting dozens of cupcakes for fellowship events. What had been a relaxing hobby was suddenly filling my weekends with orders, but I loved every minute of it.
The turning point came early this year when Mrs. Kim from down the street cried happy tears over her daughter's graduation cake. She said it was the most beautiful and delicious cake she'd ever seen and eaten, and that it made the celebration perfect. That's when I realized this wasn't just something I enjoyed doing anymore – it was something I needed to do. At that very moment, i knew i found my purpose, so here we are. What began in my home kitchen has grown into LISAH'S SPRINKLED COTTAGE, where I pour the same love and care into every order that I did for my very first family cake. Whether it's your child's birthday, a church gathering, or just a Tuesday when you want something sweet, I'm here to make it special.
Baking is more than a business to me; it's a way to connect with people, celebrate life's moments, and bring joy through food.</p>
